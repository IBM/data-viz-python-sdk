# data-viz-python-sdk A toolkit for the auto generation of best practice charts


The data-viz-python-sdk is a toolkit that reads raw data and generates both the best chart to display your data. The output chart is designed to include the best practice of Data Visualisation (Gestalt theory and Pre-attentive attributes)

The initial toolkit provides four possible chart outputs: Bar Chart, Histogram, Line Chart and Scatter plot. We hope that teams find this toolkit useful and build upon the initial quartet of charts.
